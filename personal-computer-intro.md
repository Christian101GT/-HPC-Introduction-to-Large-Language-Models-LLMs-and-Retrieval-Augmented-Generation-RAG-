## 📝 **Topics Covered** 📚

### 1. **Command Terminal Basics** ⌨️
   - **What is the Terminal?** 🤔
     - The terminal is like a **text-based remote control** for your computer. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands to make things happen.
     - Think of it as a **secret code** to unlock your computer’s powers! 🔓

   - **How to Open a Terminal** 🖱️
     - **Windows**:
       1. Open the **Ubuntu** app (or another Linux app) from the Start menu.
     - **macOS**:
       1. Open **Spotlight Search** (press `Cmd + Space`).
       2. Type `Terminal` and press `Enter`.

### 2. **Introduction to AI** 🤖
   - **What is AI?** 🤔
     - AI (Artificial Intelligence) is when computers can do things that usually need human brains, like understanding language or recognizing faces.
     - **Examples**:
       - **Chatbots**: AI that talks to you (e.g., ChatGPT). 💬
       - **Image Recognition**: AI that knows what’s in a photo (e.g., facial recognition). 📸
       - **Recommendations**: AI that suggests movies or songs (e.g., Netflix). 🍿

   - **Why is AI Cool?** 🌟
     - It powers self-driving cars 🚗, helps doctors diagnose diseases 🏥, and even beats humans at video games 🎮!

---

### 3. **What is Docker?** 🐳
   - **Why Use Docker?** 🤔
     - Docker is like a **magic box** that holds everything your software needs to run. It makes sure your code works the same way on any computer.
     - No more “it works on my computer” problems! 🎉

   - **How Docker Works** ⚙️
     - Docker puts your software in a **container**—a lightweight, portable box that includes everything it needs to run.
     - It’s like packing your lunch in a lunchbox 🍱—everything you need is in one place!

### 4. **Getting Started with Jupyter** 📓✨
   - **What is Jupyter Notebook?** 🤔
     - Jupyter Notebook is like a **digital notebook** where you can write code, see results, and add notes—all in one place.
     - It’s perfect for experimenting with AI and making cool visuals! 🎨

   - **How to Use Jupyter** 🖥️
     - We’ve prepared a **pre-built Docker image** with everything you need. Just follow these steps:
       1. **Install Docker** (if not already installed):
          - [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
       2. **Run the Docker Image**:
          - Open your terminal and run:
            ```bash
            docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
            ```
       3. **Access Jupyter**:
          - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8888`.
          - Enter the token from the terminal to start coding!
