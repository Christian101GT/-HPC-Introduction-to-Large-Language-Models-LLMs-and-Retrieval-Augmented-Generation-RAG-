In this session, you’ll discover the magic of AI! We’ll introduce you to fun AI demos, teach you the basics of Python programming, and get hands-on with Jupyter Notebooks—all without needing any setup or experience.

---

## 📌 What You Will Learn
- AI and its cool uses in your life
- Fun AI demos (like ChatGPT and DALL·E)
- The basics of Jupyter Notebooks (with step-by-step instructions)
- Python programming: Print messages, do math, and interact with your code

---

## 📖 1. What is AI?
AI is when machines learn and think like humans. You probably see AI all around you every day! Here are some examples:
- Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant
- AI-generated text and art from ChatGPT and DALL·E
- Filters on apps like Snapchat and Instagram
- Recommendations for movies, songs, and videos on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify

**🤔 Quick Question for You:** Can you think of other places you see AI in your life? Write it down!

## 🎬 2. Fun AI Demos
Now that we know what AI is, let’s see some real-world examples in action. These demos show how fun and powerful AI can be! You don’t need to write any code for these. Just watch and enjoy!

### 🔹 ChatGPT (AI that writes text)
- **Type:** "Write a funny story about a robot in school."
- **Question for you:** Why do you think AI sometimes gives weird answers?

### 🔹 DALL·E (AI that creates images)
- **Type:** "A futuristic high school classroom with AI-powered robots."
- Watch AI create a picture based on your words!

### 🔹 Teachable Machine (No-code AI Training!)
Teachable Machine allows you to train an AI without writing a single line of code!  
Train the AI to recognize your hand gestures (✋✊✌️).

### 🔹 Quick, Draw! (AI that guesses your drawings)
- **Try it out:** [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)  
- Draw something, and watch AI guess what it is!  
- **Question for you:** How accurate is the AI at guessing your drawings?

## 💻 3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks
### 🔹 What is a Jupyter Notebook?
Jupyter is a cool tool that lets you run Python code in the cloud—no installation needed. It’s like a digital notebook where you can write and run code at the same time.

### 🔹 Open Google Colab (It’s easy!)
Let’s get started by opening Google Colab (it’s an online Jupyter Notebook, and we don’t need to install anything).
1️⃣ Click on this link to open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2️⃣ When it opens, click **New Notebook** (this opens a fresh code page).  
3️⃣ Delete the first empty cell (just click on the trash can icon to delete it).  

**📌 Quick Tip:** You’re now inside your first Jupyter Notebook! Every time you write Python code here, you can see the result right away.

## 🐍 4. Writing Your First Python Code
Python is the easiest programming language to get started with. Let's write some simple Python code!

### 🔹 Print a Message
Python can print things out for you. Let’s make it print "Hello AI!"  
1️⃣ In the cell, type the following code:  
```python
print("Hello AI!")
```
2️⃣ Press Shift + Enter to run the code!  
What happened?: You just made the computer say “Hello AI!”  

### 🔹 Do Basic Math
Python can also do math! Try this:  
1️⃣ Type the following code:  
```python
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b
print("The sum is:", sum)
```
2️⃣ Press Shift + Enter.  
What happened?: The computer added the numbers 10 and 5 and showed you the result.  

### 🔹 Ask AI a Question (Interact with the Code)
Now, let's ask Python for input!  
1️⃣ Type the following:  
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
```
2️⃣ Press Shift + Enter.  
What happened?: The program will ask you your name, and then it will print a greeting with your name!

## 🎨 5. Hands-on AI Activity (Zero-Code Fun)
Now, let’s get interactive with AI! You’ll train a model to recognize your hand gestures—no code required.

### 🔹 Train Your Own AI Model!
1️⃣ Go to Teachable Machine.  
2️⃣ Choose Image Project → Standard Image Model.  
3️⃣ Record three hand gestures (✋✊✌️).  
4️⃣ Click Train Model → Preview to see AI recognize your gestures.  
What happened? AI learned to recognize your hand movements!  

### 🔹 Quick, Draw! (AI that learns from your drawings)
1️⃣ Go to Quick, Draw!.  
2️⃣ Draw something simple (like a cat, house, or tree).  
3️⃣ Watch as AI tries to guess what you’re drawing in real-time!  
What happened? AI is learning from millions of drawings to guess what you’re drawing!

## 🔥 6. Wrap-Up & Next Steps
Great job! You’ve just taken your first step into the world of AI. Here's what we learned:

- AI is everywhere—from voice assistants to movie recommendations!  
- Jupyter Notebooks help us run Python code easily in the cloud.  
- We learned some Python basics: printing, math, and taking input from users.  
- We even trained an AI without writing code!  

🚀 **Next Workshop:**  
Next time, we will dive into data exploration—we’ll analyze real AI datasets and create colorful charts using Python.  

📝 **Homework (Optional but Fun!)**  
1️⃣ Explore ChatGPT: Ask it fun or silly questions!  
2️⃣ Try DALL·E: Generate an AI image and share it with a friend.  
3️⃣ Play around with the Python code: Try changing numbers and text in the code we wrote.  
4️⃣ Try Quick, Draw!: See how well AI can guess your drawings!
