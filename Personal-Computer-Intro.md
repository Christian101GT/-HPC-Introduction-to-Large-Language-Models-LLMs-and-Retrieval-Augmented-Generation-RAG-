# 📖 **1. What is AI?** 🤔
### **AI = Machines that Think!** 💡
AI is when computers learn and make decisions like humans. You already use AI every day!

🗣️ **Voice assistants** like **Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant**  
🎭 **AI-generated art & text** from **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"}** & **[DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e){:target="_blank"}**  
📸 **Photo filters** on Snapchat & Instagram  
🎥 **Movie & music recommendations** on Netflix, YouTube, & Spotify  

💡 **Quick Thought:** Where else do you see AI? Jot down your ideas! 📝

# 🎬 **2. Fun AI Demos** 🎮
### **🤖 ChatGPT (AI that Writes)** 📝💡
**Try this:** "Write a funny story about a robot in school."
🔗 [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"}

### **🎨 DALL·E (AI that Creates Art)** 🖼️
**Try this:** "A futuristic high school classroom with AI-powered robots."
🔗 [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e){:target="_blank"}

### **🎓 Teachable Machine (Train an AI!)** 🤖
No coding needed! Teach AI to recognize hand gestures (✋✊✌️).

# 💻 **3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks** 🖥️
### **What is a Jupyter Notebook?** 📒
A Jupyter Notebook is like a **smart digital notebook** where you can write and run Python code **in small sections (cells).** Think of it as typing notes and instantly running experiments on a computer! 📝💡

🔹 **Jupyter = Digital Lab Notebook for AI & Coding!** 🚀

### **🚀 Open Google Colab (Easiest Way!)**
1️⃣ Click **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){:target="_blank"}**  
2️⃣ Click **New Notebook**  
3️⃣ 🎉 You’re ready to code!

💡 **Why Google Colab?** No installation required! Just open the link and start coding. 🚀

---

# 🐍 **4. Your First Python Code (Step-by-Step)** 🚀
### **🔹 Print a Message** 📢
👉 **Step 1:** Click inside a code cell  
👉 **Step 2:** Type this code:  
```python
print("Hello AI World!")
```
👉 **Step 3:** Press **Shift + Enter** to run it! 🎉

### **🔹 Do Basic Math** ➕➖
```python
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b
print("The sum is:", sum)
```
🧐 **What’s happening?** The computer adds 10 + 5 and prints the result! 🔢

### **🔹 AI-Powered Interaction** 🤖
```python
name = input("What’s your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
```
🎯 **Challenge:** Modify the message or numbers and rerun!

💡 **Extra Tip:** Google Colab allows you to run one code block at a time. If something goes wrong, just re-run the block!

# 🎭 **5. No-Code AI Activity (Hands-On!)** 🎨
🔹 **Train Your Own AI!** 🏆
1️⃣ Go to **[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/){:target="_blank"}**  
2️⃣ Choose **Image Project** → **Standard Image Model**  
3️⃣ Train AI to recognize three hand gestures (✋✊✌️)  
4️⃣ Click **Train Model** → **Preview** to test!

🔹 **Play Quick, Draw! (AI That Learns From Your Sketches)** ✏️
1️⃣ Go to **[Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/){:target="_blank"}**  
2️⃣ Draw simple objects (cat, house, tree)  
3️⃣ Watch AI try to guess your drawings! 🎨

# 🎯 **6. Wrap-Up & Next Steps**
🎉 **Great job!** You explored AI, learned Python, and even trained an AI model! Here’s what we covered:
✅ AI is all around us—from voice assistants to movie recommendations! 🎥🎶  
✅ Jupyter Notebooks let us write and run Python code in the cloud ☁️💻  
✅ We wrote Python code: printing, doing math, and taking user input 🐍✍️  
✅ We trained an AI—without writing any code! 🎓🤖  

🚀 **Next Workshop:** We’ll explore **real AI datasets** and make **colorful charts** using Python! 📊✨
