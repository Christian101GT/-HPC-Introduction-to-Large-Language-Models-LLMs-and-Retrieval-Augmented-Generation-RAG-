# 🤖 Retrieving Information Using RAG and Llama Model 🔍

Welcome to this exciting workshop, where you'll learn how to retrieve information efficiently and enhance it with a **Llama model** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**! 🚀 This workshop introduces you to the powerful combination of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval to improve AI performance.

---

## 🖥️ **What You’ll Learn** 🎓
- What **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is and how it improves AI capabilities.
- How to set up and use a **Llama model** to generate insights from external data.
- The importance of combining retrieval with generation for smarter AI systems.

---

## 🚀 **Why Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?** 🌟
- RAG is a way to make AI smarter by retrieving relevant information from a database and combining it with a language model’s ability to generate meaningful responses.
- Using **Llama** allows you to leverage advanced AI models to understand and process complex data, especially when data retrieval is crucial.

---

## 🛠️ **What You’ll Need** 🧰
- A **Docker image** with all necessary libraries installed for the workshop.
- **Python** installed for running the code.
- **Llama 3.3 model** for powerful AI generation.

---

## 📝 **Step-by-Step Guide** 📚

---

### 1. **What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?** 🤔
   - **RAG** combines **retrieval** (fetching relevant data) and **generation** (creating text based on data) to improve AI accuracy and make it more efficient.
   - The **Llama model** can be used to generate responses based on the retrieved data, improving the performance of your AI system.

---

### 2. **Setting Up Your Environment with Docker** 🐳
   - We’ll use a **Docker image** that has all the required machine learning libraries pre-installed:
     1. **Pull the Docker Image**:
        - In the terminal, type:
          ```bash
          docker pull ghcr.io/openai/llama-3.3:latest
          ```
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve pulled the **Llama 3.3** Docker image with all the necessary libraries to work with.

---

### 3. **Starting the Docker Container** 🚀
   - After pulling the Docker image, we need to start a container:
     1. **Run the Docker Container**:
        - Type:
          ```bash
          docker run -it ghcr.io/openai/llama-3.3:latest
          ```
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve started the Docker container where you’ll run your code.

---

### 4. **Install Necessary Python Libraries** 📦
   - To interact with the Llama model and set up RAG, we need some additional libraries. Let’s install them:
     1. **Install the Libraries**:
        - In the Docker container, type:
          ```bash
          pip install transformers langchain
          ```
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve installed **transformers** (for working with Llama) and **langchain** (for RAG implementation).

---

### 5. **Preparing the Data** 🛠️
   - Now, let’s prepare the data that will be used for retrieval:
     1. **Create a Simple Document Database**:
        - You can create a text file or use an in-memory database like **FAISS** for the workshop. Here's an example:
          ```python
          documents = [
              "The Llama model is a powerful AI language model developed by Meta.",
              "Retrieval-Augmented Generation helps combine external data with AI generation.",
              "In RAG, relevant information is retrieved from a database and used to generate responses."
          ]
          ```
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve set up a simple database of documents for retrieval.

---

### 6. **Set Up the RAG Pipeline** 🔧
   - Next, we’ll set up the **RAG** pipeline to combine document retrieval and generation:
     1. **Define the RAG Setup**:
        - Type:
          ```python
          from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
          from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
          from transformers import LlamaTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM

          # Initialize the Llama model and tokenizer
          tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("llama-3.3")
          model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("llama-3.3")

          # Initialize FAISS vector store for document retrieval
          # Example setup
          faiss_index = FAISS.from_documents(documents)

          # Create the RAG chain
          rag_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(model=model, retriever=faiss_index)
          ```
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve set up the RAG pipeline, including document retrieval and text generation.

---

### 7. **Ask Questions and Get Answers!** ❓
   - Now, you can ask questions and get answers by combining the retrieval process with Llama’s generation abilities:
     1. **Ask a Question**:
        - Type:
          ```python
          question = "What is the Llama model?"
          answer = rag_chain.run(question)

          print("Answer: ", answer)
          ```
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve asked a question, and the RAG system combined retrieval and generation to provide an answer!

---

### 8. **Experiment and Explore** 🌟
   - Feel free to experiment with different documents and questions to explore the power of RAG and Llama!

---

## 🎯 **Quick Challenge** 🏆
- **Add More Documents**:
  - Try adding more documents to the retrieval system and see how the answers change. The more relevant documents you have, the better the model will perform.

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Tips** 🔧
- **Model Not Running?**
  - Make sure the Docker container is running properly and all libraries are installed correctly.
- **Slow Response?**
  - Check your document database size; the larger it is, the longer retrieval may take.
