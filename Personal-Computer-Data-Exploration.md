# 📖 **1. What Are AI Datasets?** 🤔
### **AI Needs Data to Learn!** 📂
AI models learn from **datasets**, which are collections of data used to train and test AI systems. These can be:

📸 **Images** (e.g., photos of cats and dogs for image recognition)  
📜 **Text** (e.g., articles, social media posts for chatbots)  
📊 **Numbers** (e.g., sales data, stock prices for predictions)  
🎵 **Audio** (e.g., voice recordings for speech recognition)  

💡 **Quick Thought:** Where else do you think AI uses data? Jot down your ideas! 📝

# 🎬 **2. Exploring a Real AI Dataset** 🔍
We'll use a simple dataset that contains information about different types of flowers. 🌸🌻🌿

### **🚀 Open Google Colab (Easiest Way!)**
1️⃣ Click **<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>**  
2️⃣ Click **New Notebook**  
3️⃣ 🎉 You’re ready to code!

---

# 💻 **3. Loading and Viewing the Dataset** 🖥️
### **🔹 Load the Dataset** 📥
👉 **Step 1:** Click inside a code cell and copy-paste the following code:  
```python
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Load a sample dataset
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

# Display the first few rows
iris.head()
```
👉 **Step 2:** Press the **Play Icon** ▶️ to run it! 🎉  
✅ You should see a table displaying different types of flowers and their measurements.

# 🎨 **4. Creating Colorful Charts with Python** 📊
### **🔹 Bar Chart (Comparing Categories)**
👉 **Step 1:** Copy-paste this code into a new cell:  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create a bar chart
sns.barplot(x="species", y="sepal_length", data=iris)
plt.title("Average Sepal Length of Flower Species")
plt.show()
```
👉 **Step 2:** Press the **Play Icon** ▶️ to run it!  
✅ You should see a colorful bar chart comparing different flower species. 🌺📊

### **🔹 Scatter Plot (Finding Patterns in Data)**
👉 **Step 1:** Copy-paste this code into a new cell:  
```python
# Create a scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x="sepal_length", y="sepal_width", hue="species", data=iris)
plt.title("Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width")
plt.show()
```
👉 **Step 2:** Press the **Play Icon** ▶️ to run it!  
✅ This chart helps us see patterns in the data! 🎨📊
