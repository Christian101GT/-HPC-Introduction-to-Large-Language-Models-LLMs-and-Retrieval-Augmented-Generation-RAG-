# 🚀 Workshop 1: Intro to AI & Jupyter (Make AI Feel Real!)

## 🎯 Goal  
Get excited about AI before touching code! This session introduces AI concepts, showcases fun demos, and sets up Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on learning.

---

## 📌 What You Will Learn  
✅ What AI is and where we see it daily  
✅ Fun AI demos (ChatGPT, DALL·E, Teachable Machine)  
✅ Basics of Jupyter Notebooks (in Google Colab—no setup needed!)  
✅ Intro to Python: Print messages, basic math

## 📖 1. What is AI?  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to **learn, reason, and make decisions** like humans. You probably use AI every day in things like:

- **Voice assistants:** Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant  
- **AI-generated art & text:** DALL·E, ChatGPT  
- **Face recognition & filters:** Snapchat, Instagram  
- **Recommendation systems:** YouTube, Netflix, Spotify  

🤔 **Think about it:** Can you think of other ways AI might be in your life?

## 🎬 2. Fun AI Demos  
Here are some real AI applications for you to explore before diving into the code!

### 🔹 **ChatGPT (Text AI)**  
- Ask: *"Write a funny story about a robot in school."*  
- Discuss: *Why do you think AI sometimes gives weird answers?*

### 🔹 **DALL·E (Image AI)**  
- Generate an image from text: *"A futuristic high school classroom with AI-powered robots."*  
- See what fun images AI can create!

### 🔹 **Teachable Machine (Zero-Code AI!)**  
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) lets you train an AI **without coding**!  
- Train AI to recognize **hand gestures** (✋✊✌️).

## 💻 3. Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks  
### 🔹 What is Jupyter Notebook?  
Jupyter Notebooks are **interactive tools** where you can write and run Python code. It’s used by many AI engineers to develop models and analyze data!

### 🔹 Open Google Colab (No Installation Needed!)  
1️⃣ Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
2️⃣ Click **New Notebook**  
3️⃣ Delete the first empty cell (this will give you a clean slate)

**Tip:** Don't worry about installing anything—everything works directly in your browser!  

---

## 🐍 4. Writing Your First Python Code  
Python is the most common language for working with AI. Here’s how you can write some basic code in Jupyter Notebook!

### 🔹 Print a message  
1. Copy the following code and paste it into a new cell in Google Colab:

```python
print("Hello AI!")
```

2. Press the play button on the left to **run the code** (it’s the little triangle symbol). You should see "Hello AI!" appear in the output section below.

### 🔹 Do Basic Math  
1. In a new cell, paste this code to do some math:

```python
a = 10  
b = 5  
sum = a + b  
print("The sum is:", sum)
```

2. Press the play button to **run** the code and see the result.

### 🔹 Ask AI a Question (Basic Input)  
You can even ask Python for your name!

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")  
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
```

**Tip:** Don't forget to hit the play button each time you add new code!

## 🎨 5. Hands-on AI Activity (Zero Code)
Now, let’s have some fun! We’re going to train an AI model **without writing any code** using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

### Steps to Train AI to Recognize Hand Gestures  
1. Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).  
2. Click **Image Project → Standard Image Model**.  
3. Record three hand gestures (✋✊✌️).  
4. Click **Train Model → Preview** to see how AI recognizes your hand movements!

**What happened?** The AI learned to recognize your gestures in real-time!

## 🔥 6. Wrap-Up & Next Steps
### ✅ What You Learned Today  
- **AI is everywhere!** You’ve seen examples of AI in daily life.  
- **AI can generate text and images** (ChatGPT, DALL·E).  
- **Jupyter Notebooks are super easy** for writing and running Python code.  
- **Python is simple:** You printed messages, did math, and even got user input!

### 🚀 What’s Coming in the Next Workshop  
In the next session, we’ll dive into **Data Exploration & Management** and explore real AI datasets. We’ll even create colorful charts with Python!

---

## 📝 Homework (Optional)
1. Explore **ChatGPT**: Ask it fun questions like "Tell me a joke!"  
2. Try **DALL·E**: Generate an image and share it with your friends.  
3. **Modify Python Code**: Change numbers/messages and see what happens when you run the code again!
