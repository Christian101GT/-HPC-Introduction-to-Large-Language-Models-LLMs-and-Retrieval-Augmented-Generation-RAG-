# 🤖 Simple Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression 🌱

Welcome to the next workshop in your AI journey! 🚀 In this workshop, you'll learn how to use **Logistic Regression** to build a simple **Machine Learning (ML)** model to classify the famous **Iris dataset**. This is a basic yet powerful method to get started with machine learning!

---

## 🖥️ **What You’ll Learn** 🎓
- What **Logistic Regression** is and how it works.
- How to build a **simple machine learning model** to classify flowers.
- How to **train and test** the model using real data.

---

## 🚀 **Why Use Logistic Regression?** 🌟
- Logistic Regression is a simple and easy-to-understand model.
- It’s good for problems where you need to predict categories or classes (like deciding whether something is **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** in the Iris dataset).
- It’s also a good **starting point** for exploring machine learning algorithms.

---

## 🛠️ **What You’ll Need** 🧰
- A running **Jupyter Notebook**.
- The **Iris dataset** (we'll use the one from the `sklearn` library).

---

## 📝 **Step-by-Step Guide** 📚

---

### 1. **What is Logistic Regression?** 🤔
   - **Logistic Regression** is a type of machine learning algorithm used for **classification** problems (where the goal is to predict categories).
   - It finds the relationship between the input features (like **sepal length**, **sepal width**, etc.) and the target (the species of the flower).
   - The model outputs probabilities, and we use a **threshold** (e.g., 50%) to decide which class the data point belongs to.

---

### 2. **Load the Dataset** 📂
   - First, we’ll load the Iris dataset and check the data:
     1. **Import Libraries**:
        - In a new cell, type:
          ```python
          # Import the required libraries
          import pandas as pd
          from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
          from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
          from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
          from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

          print("Libraries imported successfully! 🎉")
          ```
        - Press `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve imported libraries needed for loading the dataset, splitting data, training the model, and checking accuracy.

     2. **Load the Dataset**:
        - In the next cell, type:
          ```python
          # Load the Iris dataset
          iris = load_iris()

          # Turn the dataset into a DataFrame
          data = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
          
          # Add the target (species) column to the dataset
          data['species'] = iris.target

          print("Dataset loaded successfully! 🎉")
          ```
        - Press `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve loaded the Iris dataset and added a new column for the species.

     3. **View the Data**:
        - To see the first few rows of the dataset, type:
          ```python
          # Display the first 5 rows of the dataset
          display(data.head())

          print("First 5 rows displayed! 🎉")
          ```
        - Press `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ll see the first few rows of the Iris dataset, including **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, **petal width**, and **species**.

---

### 3. **Prepare the Data** 🛠️
   - We’ll split the data into **training** and **testing** sets:
     1. **Split the Data**:
        - Type:
          ```python
          # Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y)
          X = data.drop('species', axis=1)  # Features: everything except the species column
          y = data['species']  # Target: the species column

          # Split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing)
          X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

          print("Data split into training and testing sets! 🎉")
          ```
        - Press `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You've split the dataset into features (`X`) and target (`y`), and divided it into training and testing sets.

---

### 4. **Train the Logistic Regression Model** 🏋️‍♀️
   - Now we’ll train the Logistic Regression model:
     1. **Create and Train the Model**:
        - Type:
          ```python
          # Create the Logistic Regression model
          model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)

          # Train the model using the training data
          model.fit(X_train, y_train)

          print("Model trained successfully! 🎉")
          ```
        - Press `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve trained the Logistic Regression model using the training data.

---

### 5. **Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model** 📈
   - Let’s check how well our model performs by making predictions:
     1. **Make Predictions**:
        - Type:
          ```python
          # Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data
          y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

          print("Predictions made successfully! 🎉")
          ```
        - Press `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve used the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

     2. **Evaluate the Model**:
        - Type:
          ```python
          # Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing the predictions to the true labels
          accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

          print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}% 🎉")
          ```
        - Press `Shift + Enter` to run the code.
        - **What Happened?** 🎉
          - You’ve calculated the accuracy of the model by comparing its predictions to the true labels.

---

### 6. **Interpret the Results** 🧐
   - If the accuracy is high, that means the model is doing a great job of classifying the species! 🎉
   - A lower accuracy might mean that the model needs more training, or that the data has features that aren’t helpful for classification.

---

## 🎯 **Quick Challenge** 🏆
- **Change the Model Parameters**:
  - Try changing the `max_iter` parameter to a lower value and see how it affects the accuracy.
  - Example:
    ```python
    # Create the Logistic Regression model with a lower number of iterations
    model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=100)
    ```

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Tips** 🔧
- **Model Not Training?**
  - Make sure you've split the data properly and check for any errors in the code.
- **Accuracy is Low?**
  - Try adjusting model parameters or using more features to improve performance.
