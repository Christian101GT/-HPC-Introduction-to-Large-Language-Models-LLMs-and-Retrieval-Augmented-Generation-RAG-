## 🤔 **1. Understanding Machine Learning**  

### **What is Machine Learning?**  
Machine Learning (ML) is a way for computers to **learn from data** and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. Some examples include:  

🎵 **Music Recommendations** (e.g., Spotify suggesting songs you might like)  
📧 **Spam Detection** (e.g., filtering junk emails)  
🚗 **Self-Driving Cars** (e.g., recognizing pedestrians and traffic signs)  

💡 **Think:** Where else do you see AI making predictions in real life? 🤔💭

## 📊 **4. Loading and Exploring the Dataset**  

### **Step 4: Add a New Code Cell**  
1️⃣ Click **+ Code** to add another code cell.  
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following code into the new code cell.  

```python
# Create a simple dataset
np.random.seed(0)  # Ensure reproducibility
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10  # Random numbers between 0 and 10
y = 2.5 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 2  # Linear relation with some noise

# Convert to DataFrame for better visualization
data = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': X.flatten(), 'Target': y.flatten()})
data.head()  # Display the first few rows
```

### **Step 5: Run the Code**

## ✂ **5. Splitting the Data**  

### **Step 6: Add a New Code Cell**  
1️⃣ Click **+ Code** to add another code cell.  
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following code into the new code cell.  

```python
# Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Show the size of training and testing sets
X_train.shape, X_test.shape
```

### **Step 7: Run the Code**  
▶ Click **Run** (▶) to check the data split.  

---

## 🤖 **6. Training the Machine Learning Model**

1️⃣ Click **+ Code** to add another code cell.  
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following code into the new code cell.  

```python
# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model using training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### **Step 9: Run the Code**  
▶ Click **Run** (▶) to train the model.  

---

## 🔮 **7. Making Predictions**  

### **Step 10: Add a New Code Cell**  
1️⃣ Click **+ Code** to add another code cell.  
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following code into the new code cell.  

```python
# Predict using the test dataset
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display first few predictions
pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test.flatten(), 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()}).head()
```

### **Step 11: Run the Code**  
▶ Click **Run** (▶) to see how well the model is predicting values.  

---

## 📉 **8. Evaluating the Model**  

### **Step 12: Add a New Code Cell**
